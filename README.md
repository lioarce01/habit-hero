# 🎮 HABIT HERO
### Transform Your Daily Habits Into Epic Adventures

---

## 🌟 What is Habit Hero?

**Habit Hero** turns boring habit tracking into an exciting role-playing game! Instead of just checking boxes, you become a legendary hero who gains experience points, levels up, and unlocks achievements by completing your daily goals.

Think of it as **Pokémon GO meets your daily routine** - every workout becomes a battle, every book you read makes you wiser, and every healthy meal increases your vitality!

## 🎮 How It Works

### 1. 🧙‍♂️ **Choose Your Hero Class**
When you start, you pick your heroic identity:

- **🗡️ Warrior** - Perfect for fitness enthusiasts who want to build physical strength
- **🧙‍♂️ Mage** - Ideal for learners, readers, and knowledge seekers
- **🛡️ Paladin** - Great for health and wellness focused individuals
- **🏹 Ranger** - Best for lifestyle and personal growth goals

### 2. ⚔️ **Create Your Daily Quests**
Transform your habits into heroic missions:

- "Morning Meditation Ritual" instead of "Meditate 10 minutes"
- "Conquest of the 10,000 Steps" instead of "Walk daily"
- "Ancient Scrolls Study Session" instead of "Read for 30 minutes"
- "Hydration Elixir Consumption" instead of "Drink 8 glasses of water"

### 3. 📊 **Watch Your Hero Grow**
Every completed quest gives you:

- **Experience Points (XP)** that make you level up
- **Stat Boosts** in Power, Wisdom, Vitality, or Spirit
- **Streak Multipliers** that increase rewards for consistency
- **Epic Achievements** and titles to unlock

### 4. 🔥 **Build Legendary Streaks**
The longer you maintain your habits, the more powerful you become:

- **7 days** = "Streak Warrior" title
- **30 days** = "Dedication Master" achievement
- **100 days** = "Legendary Hero" status

## ❓ **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **Q: What happens if I miss a day?**
A: Don't worry! Missing one day doesn't reset everything. Your level and total XP remain, but your streak for that specific quest will reset to zero. The app is designed to help you get back on track, not punish you for being human.

### **Q: Can I change my hero class later?**
A: Your hero class is mainly cosmetic and affects your starting theme. You can build any type of habits regardless of your class. The important part is your stats growth, which depends on the quests you complete.

### **Q: How do difficulty levels work?**
A: Higher difficulty quests give more XP but should represent genuinely harder habits:
- **Novice (1 star)**: Easy daily habits - 10 XP
- **Adept (2 stars)**: Moderate challenges - 20 XP  
- **Master (3 stars)**: Difficult commitments - 30 XP

### **Q: What's the maximum level?**
A: There's no level cap! The XP required increases with each level, but you can always keep growing. Some heroes have reached Level 50+ and beyond!

### **Q: Can I use this with friends?**
A: Currently, Habit Hero is focused on your personal journey. Each account tracks individual progress. However, you can share your achievements and inspire friends to start their own heroic journey!

### **Q: Is my data safe?**
A: Yes! All your progress is securely stored in the cloud and protected with industry-standard security. Your data is private and only accessible by you.
